  <p> Woodland's parent company, Aero Group, has been a well known name in the outdoor shoe industry since the early 50s. Founded in Quebec, Canada, it entered the Indian market in 1992. Before that, Aero Group was majorly exporting its leather shoes to USSR. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union into various states, the group decided to launch some of its products in India. Hence, the first hand-stitched leather shoe was launched, which took the entire shoe market by storm. That shoe made the brand 'Woodland'.</p>
